# Hangman-Game-OOP
Better Hangman than my previous one, because this one uses OOP and is easier to read.

How to Play:

Find a person to play against, and each person gets a turn to type in a word

First person to guess the word wins, by either guessing the letter or the word completely

If you guess incorrectly 6 times, the other player wins
